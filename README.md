In this 2d game you have to smash skeletons, zombies and ghosts in the head with a big hammer in order to keep them from exit their tombs.
Sounds a little creepy, but it is not :)

Game is written in c++ with SDL3.

It features programmer arts at its finest.

Localization is missing, the few words in the game are in italian. Click on "Gioca" to start play.

Build from sources
-------------------------

Probably nobody will do this and I'm not a fan of build systems.
All you have is a good old bat in the build dir. Arrange it with the path of your SDL3.
The only dependances is SDL3, SDL3_image and SDL3_ttf.

I developed the game in Notepad++ (Windows), so no project files are included.
